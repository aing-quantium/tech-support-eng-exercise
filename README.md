# Tech Support Engineer - Candidate Exercise

## Objective

This repository contains two short technical exercises used in a candidate interview for a Tech Support Engineer position. The goal is to assess problem-solving, debugging, and basic development skills. Candidates should read each project's README, run the code/tests, fix or implement the required behavior, and document their approach and reasoning.

## Projects

- **Test 1 — MakeItWorks:** [Test1-MakeItWorks/README.md](Test1-MakeItWorks/README.md) — small JavaScript tasks to implement or fix basic functions (see files like `fibo.js` and `xmas.js`).
- **Test 2 — FixThisTest:** [Test2-FixThisTest/README.md](Test2-FixThisTest/README.md) — a unit-test-focused exercise where a failing test must be fixed; includes `package.json` and test files under `Test2-FixThisTest/test`.

## How to run

- Test 1 (manual/run with Node):

	- Run a script directly, for example:

		```bash
        cd Test1-MakeItWorks
		node fibo.js
        node xmas.js
		```

- Test 2 (npm + tests):

	- Change into the test folder, install dependencies, and run tests:

		```bash
		cd Test2-FixThisTest
		npm install
		npm test
		```

## Submission

Please provide:

- A brief summary of what you changed and why.
- Any assumptions or edge-cases you considered.
